@def rss = "A short description of the page which would serve as **blurb** in a `RSS` feed; you can use basic markdown here but the whole description string must be a single line (not a multiline string). Like this one for instance. Keep in mind that styling is minimal in RSS so for instance don't expect maths or fancy styling to work; images should be ok though: ![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/3/32/Rick_and_Morty_opening_credits.jpeg)"

In building the package PlaneGeometry.jl and this website, I was helped by many people form the
Julia community, in particular, [Thibaut Lienart](https://github.com/tlienart) and [John
Verzani](https://github.com/jverzani). I want thank them and everyone who has contributed in open
source software movement. Your generosity is appreciated!
