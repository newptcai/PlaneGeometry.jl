In building the package PlaneGeometry.jl and this website, I was helped by many people form the
Julia community, in particular, [Thibaut Lienart](https://github.com/tlienart) and [John
Verzani](https://github.com/jverzani). I want thank them and everyone who has contributed in open
source software movement. Your generosity is appreciated!
