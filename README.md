![Napoleon's Theorem](docs/src/assets/PlaneGeometry.svg)

This package originated from a [blog post](https://newptcai.github.io/category/math.html) I wrote on
proving Napoleon's theorem with Julia. I have since cleaned up the code and add a [new
theorem](https://newptcai.github.io/PlaneGeometry.jl/theorem/Centroid/). Please see [the document](https://newptcai.github.io/PlaneGeometry.jl/) for
details.
